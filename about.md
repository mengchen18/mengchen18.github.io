My name is Chen Meng. I am a computational biologist working in the Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich. We are a proteomics group, generate tons of proteomics data and analyze them. My research interest is all about "turning biological data into testable hypothesis", using the combination of mutlivariate analysis, data integration, interactive visualization and data annotation methods.
